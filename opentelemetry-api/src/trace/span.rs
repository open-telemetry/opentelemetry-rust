/// The interface for a single operation within a trace.
///
/// Spans can be nested to form a trace tree. Each trace contains a root span,
/// which typically describes the entire operation and, optionally, one or more
/// sub-spans for its sub-operations.
///
/// The span `name` concisely identifies the work represented by the span, for
/// example, an RPC method name, a function name, or the name of a subtask or
/// stage within a larger computation. The span name should be the most general
/// string that identifies a (statistically) interesting class of spans, rather
/// than individual span instances while still being human-readable. That is,
/// `"get_user"` is a reasonable name, while `"get_user/314159"`, where `"314159"` is
/// a user ID, is not a good name due to its high cardinality. _Generality_
/// should be prioritized over _human-readability_.
///
/// For example, here are potential span names for an endpoint that gets a
/// hypothetical account information:
///
/// | Span Name         | Guidance     |
/// | ----------------- | ------------ |
/// | `get`             | Too general  |
/// | `get_account/42`  | Too specific |
/// | `get_account`     | Good, and account_id=42 would make a nice Span attribute |
/// | `get_account/{accountId}` | Also good (using the "HTTP route") |
///
/// The span's start and end timestamps reflect the elapsed real time of the
/// operation.
///
/// For example, if a span represents a request-response cycle (e.g. HTTP or an
/// RPC), the span should have a start time that corresponds to the start time
/// of the first sub-operation, and an end time of when the final sub-operation
/// is complete. This includes:
///
/// * receiving the data from the request
/// * parsing of the data (e.g. from a binary or json format)
/// * any middleware or additional processing logic
/// * business logic
/// * construction of the response
/// * sending of the response
///
/// Child spans (or in some cases events) may be created to represent
/// sub-operations which require more detailed observability. Child spans should
/// measure the timing of the respective sub-operation, and may add additional
/// attributes.

/// `SpanKind` describes the relationship between the [`Span`], its parents, and
/// its children in a trace.
///
/// `SpanKind` describes two independent properties that benefit tracing systems
/// during analysis:
///
/// The first property described by `SpanKind` reflects whether the span is a
/// "logical" remote child or parent. By "logical", we mean that the span is
/// logically a remote child or parent, from the point of view of the library
/// that is being instrumented. Spans with a remote parent are interesting
/// because they are sources of external load. Spans with a remote child are
/// interesting because they reflect a non-local system dependency.
///
/// The second property described by `SpanKind` reflects whether a child span
/// represents a synchronous call.  When a child span is synchronous, the parent
/// is expected to wait for it to complete under ordinary circumstances. It can
/// be useful for tracing systems to know this property, since synchronous spans
/// may contribute to the overall trace latency. Asynchronous scenarios can be
/// remote or local.
///
/// In order for `SpanKind` to be meaningful, callers should arrange that a
/// single span does not serve more than one purpose. For example, a server-side
/// span should not be used directly as the parent of another remote span. As a
/// simple guideline, instrumentation should create a new span prior to
/// extracting and serializing the SpanContext for a remote call.
///
/// Note: there are complex scenarios where a `SpanKind::Client` span may have a
/// child that is also logically a `SpanKind::Client` span, or a
/// `SpanKind::Producer` span might have a local child that is a
/// `SpanKind::Client` span, depending on how the various libraries that are
/// providing the functionality are built and instrumented. These scenarios,
/// when they occur, should be detailed in the semantic conventions appropriate
/// to the relevant libraries.
///
/// To summarize the interpretation of these kinds:
///
/// | `SpanKind` | Synchronous | Asynchronous | Remote Incoming | Remote Outgoing |
/// |---|---|---|---|---|
/// | `Client` | yes | | | yes |
/// | `Server` | yes | | yes | |
/// | `Producer` | | yes | | maybe |
/// | `Consumer` | | yes | maybe | |
/// | `Internal` | | | | |
