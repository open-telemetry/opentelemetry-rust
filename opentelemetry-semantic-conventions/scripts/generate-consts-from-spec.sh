# Semantic conventions are currently defined in Markdown files in the
# specification repository. This script downloads these files and attempts to
# find the attributes and their documentation. It then prints Rust code with
# constants for these attributes to stdout.
#
# This helps you get started but doesn't do all the things. You will need to the
# following manually:
# - This prints some attributes multiple times, because it mistakes examples for
#   attribute definitions. Remove those.
# - In some cases the description isn't parsed properly. In those cases you will
#   need to copy it manually.
# - Hard wrap description text, so it fits the code style of this repo.
# - Add URLs for links in the documentation.
