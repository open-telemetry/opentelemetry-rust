//! # Resource Semantic Conventions
//!
//! The [resource semantic conventions] define a set of standardized attributes
//! to be used in `Resource`s.
//!
//! [resource semantic conventions]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/master/specification/resource/semantic_conventions
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use opentelemetry::sdk;
//! use opentelemetry_semantic_conventions as semcov;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! let _tracer = opentelemetry::exporter::trace::stdout::new_pipeline()
//!     .with_trace_config(sdk::trace::Config {
//!         resource: Arc::new(sdk::Resource::new(vec![
//!             semcov::resource::SERVICE_NAME.string("my-service"),
//!             semcov::resource::SERVICE_NAMESPACE.string("my-namespace"),
//!         ])),
//!         ..sdk::trace::Config::default()
//!     })
//!     .install();
//! ```
