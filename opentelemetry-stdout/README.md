# OpenTelemetry Stdout Exporter

This crate contains an [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) exporter that
outputs telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces) to standard output in a
human-readable format. It is designed for educational purposes, debugging, and
development workflows where you want to quickly inspect telemetry data without
setting up external observability infrastructure.

## Overview

OpenTelemetry is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and
manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. OpenTelemetry is
vendor- and tool-agnostic, meaning that it can be used with a broad variety of
Observability backends, including open source tools like [Jaeger] and
[Prometheus], as well as commercial offerings.

OpenTelemetry is *not* an observability backend like Jaeger, Prometheus, or other
commercial vendors. OpenTelemetry is focused on the generation, collection,
management, and export of telemetry. A major goal of OpenTelemetry is that you
can easily instrument your applications or systems, no matter their language,
infrastructure, or runtime environment. Crucially, the storage and visualization
of telemetry is intentionally left to other tools.

### What does this crate contain?

This crate provides exporters that support all three OpenTelemetry signals:

- **Trace Exporter**: Outputs distributed tracing data showing request flows
  and timing information across services.
- **Metrics Exporter**: Outputs measurement data such as counters, gauges, and
  histograms for monitoring application performance.
- **Logs Exporter**: Outputs structured log data with OpenTelemetry context
  information.

All exporters format the telemetry data in a human-readable way and write it to
standard output. This crate is intended solely for educational and debugging
purposes. Please note, this crate is not optimized for performance, and the
format of the output may change, making it unsuitable for production
environments.

## Getting started

See [docs](https://docs.rs/opentelemetry-stdout).

## Release Notes

You can find the release notes (changelog) [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/blob/main/opentelemetry-stdout/CHANGELOG.md).

## Supported Rust Versions

OpenTelemetry is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is 1.75.0. The current OpenTelemetry version is not guaranteed to build
on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions
before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler
version is 1.49, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.46,
three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version
is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with
this policy.
