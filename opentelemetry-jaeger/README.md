# OpenTelemetry Jaeger (Deprecated)

This component is deleted. The release of opentelemetry-jaeger, 0.22.0, can be
found [here](https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-jaeger) If you are looking
to export traces to Jaeger, use
[opentelemetry-otlp](https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-otlp), as Jaeger
natively supports OTLP. See [this](../examples/tracing-jaeger/README.md) for an
example.

If you are looking for Jaeger propagator, it is available in the crate
[opentelemetry-jaeger-propagator](https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-jaeger-propagator).
