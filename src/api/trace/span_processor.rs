//! # OpenTelemetry Span Processor Interface
//!
//! Span processor is an interface which allows hooks for span start and end method
//! invocations. The span processors are invoked only when
//! [`is_recording`] is true.
//!
//! Built-in span processors are responsible for batching and conversion of spans to
//! exportable representation and passing batches to exporters.
//!
//! Span processors can be registered directly on SDK [`TracerProvider`] and they are
//! invoked in the same order as they were registered.
//!
//! All `Tracer` instances created by a `TracerProvider` share the same span processors.
//! Changes to this collection reflect in all `Tracer` instances.
//!
//! The following diagram shows `SpanProcessor`'s relationship to other components
//! in the SDK:
//!
//! ```ascii
