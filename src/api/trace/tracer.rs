//! # OpenTelemetry Tracer interface
//!
//! The OpenTelemetry library achieves in-process context propagation of
//! `Span`s by way of the `Tracer`.
//!
//! The `Tracer` is responsible for tracking the currently active `Span`,
//! and exposes methods for creating and activating new `Spans`. The
//! `Tracer` is configured with `Propagators` which support transferring
//! span context across process boundaries.
//!
//! `Tracer`s are generally expected to be used as singletons.
//! Implementations SHOULD provide a single global default Tracer.
//!
//! Some applications may require multiple `Tracer` instances, e.g. to
//! create `Span`s on behalf of other applications. Implementations MAY
//! provide a global registry of Tracers for such applications.
//!
//! The `Tracer` SHOULD allow end users to configure other tracing components that
//! control how `Span`s are passed across process boundaries, including the binary
//! and text format `Propagator`s used to serialize `Span`s created by the
//! `Tracer`.
//!
