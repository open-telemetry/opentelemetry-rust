//! # OpenTelemetry Sampler Interface
//!
//! ## Sampling
//!
//! Sampling is a mechanism to control the noise and overhead introduced by
//! OpenTelemetry by reducing the number of samples of traces collected and sent to
//! the backend.
//!
//! Sampling may be implemented on different stages of a trace collection.
//! OpenTelemetry API defines a `Sampler` interface that can be used at
//! instrumentation points by libraries to check the sampling `SamplingDecision` early and
//! optimize the amount of telemetry that needs to be collected.
//!
//! All other sampling algorithms may be implemented on SDK layer in exporters, or
//! even out of process in Agent or Collector.
//!
//! The OpenTelemetry API has two properties responsible for the data collection:
//!
//! * `is_recording` method on a `Span`. If `true` the current `Span` records
//!   tracing events (attributes, events, status, etc.), otherwise all tracing
//!   events are dropped. Users can use this property to determine if expensive
//!   trace events can be avoided. `SpanProcessor`s will receive
//!   all spans with this flag set. However, `SpanExporter`s will
//!   not receive them unless the `Sampled` flag was set.
//! * `Sampled` flag in `trace_flags` on `SpanContext`. This flag is propagated via
//!   the `SpanContext` to child Spans. For more details see the [W3C
//!   specification](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/). This flag indicates that
//!   the `Span` has been `sampled` and will be exported. `SpanProcessor`s and
//!   `SpanExporter`s will receive spans with the `Sampled` flag set for
//!   processing.
//!
//! The flag combination `SampledFlag == false` and `is_recording` == true`
//! means that the current `Span` does record information, but most likely the child
//! `Span` will not.
//!
//! The flag combination `SampledFlag == true` and `IsRecording == false`
//! could cause gaps in the distributed trace, and because of this OpenTelemetry API
//! MUST NOT allow this combination.
