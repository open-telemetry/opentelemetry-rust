///  exporters. The protocol exporter is expected to be primarily a simple
/// telemetry data encoder and transmitter.
/// - Allow implementing helpers as composable components that use the same
/// chainable Exporter interface. SDK authors are encouraged to implement common
/// functionality such as queuing, batching, tagging, etc. as helpers. This
/// functionality will be applicable regardless of what protocol exporter is used.
