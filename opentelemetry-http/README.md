This crate contains helper implementations for sending HTTP requests with
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) integration. Uses include propagating
and extracting context over HTTP, exporting telemetry data, and requesting
sampling strategies.

## Overview

OpenTelemetry is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and
manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. OpenTelemetry is
vendor- and tool-agnostic, meaning that it can be used with a broad variety of
Observability backends, including open source tools like [Jaeger] and
[Prometheus], as well as commercial offerings.

OpenTelemetry is *not* an observability backend like Jaeger, Prometheus, or other
commercial vendors. OpenTelemetry is focused on the generation, collection,
management, and export of telemetry. A major goal of OpenTelemetry is that you
can easily instrument your applications or systems, no matter their language,
infrastructure, or runtime environment. Crucially, the storage and visualization
of telemetry is intentionally left to other tools.

### What does this crate contain?

This crate provides HTTP utilities and integrations for OpenTelemetry,
including:

- **Context Propagation**: Helper implementations for propagating and extracting
  OpenTelemetry context over HTTP headers, enabling distributed tracing across
  service boundaries.
- **HTTP Client Support**: Integration with popular HTTP clients like `reqwest`
  and `hyper` for automatic instrumentation and context propagation.
- **Exporter Utilities**: Common HTTP functionality used by exporters to send
  telemetry data to collection endpoints.
- **Sampling Strategy Support**: Helper functions for requesting sampling
  strategies from remote endpoints.

This crate is typically used as a dependency by other OpenTelemetry components
rather than directly by end users, though it can be useful for custom
instrumentation scenarios.

### Related crates

This crate is commonly used alongside:

- **[opentelemetry](https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry):** The core OpenTelemetry API.
- **[opentelemetry-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-sdk):** The OpenTelemetry SDK implementation.
- **[opentelemetry-otlp](https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-otlp):** OTLP exporter that uses this crate for HTTP transport.

## Getting started

## Release Notes

You can find the release notes (changelog) [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/blob/main/opentelemetry-http/CHANGELOG.md).

## Supported Rust Versions

OpenTelemetry is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is 1.75.0. The current OpenTelemetry version is not guaranteed to build
on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions
before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler
version is 1.49, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.46,
three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version
is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with
this policy.
