# This workflow runs a Criterion benchmark on a PR and compares the results against the base branch.
# It is triggered on a PR or a push to main.
#
# The workflow is gated on the presence of the "performance" label on the PR.
#
# The workflow runs on a self-hosted runner pool. We can't use the shared runners for this,
# because they are only permitted to run on the default branch to preserve resources. 
#
# In the future, we might like to consider using bencher.dev or the framework used by otel-golang here.
