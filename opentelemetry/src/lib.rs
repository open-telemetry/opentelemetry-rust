//! OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector
//! services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application. You
//! can analyze them using [Prometheus], [Jaeger], and other observability tools.
//!
//! *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.56+][msrv]*
//!
//! [Prometheus]: https://prometheus.io
//! [Jaeger]: https://www.jaegertracing.io
//! [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "trace")]
//! # {
//! use opentelemetry::{global, sdk::export::trace::stdout, trace::Tracer};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create a new trace pipeline that prints to stdout
//!     let tracer = stdout::new_pipeline().install_simple();
//!
//!     tracer.in_span("doing_work", |cx| {
//!         // Traced app logic here...
//!     });
//!
//!     // Shutdown trace pipeline
//!     global::shutdown_tracer_provider();
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [examples] directory for different integration patterns.

//!
//! # Traces
//!
//! The [`trace`] module includes types for tracking the progression of a single
//! request while it is handled by services that make up an application. A trace
//! is a tree of [`Span`]s which are objects that represent the work being done
//! by individual services or components involved in a request as it flows
//! through a system.
//!
//! ### Creating and exporting spans
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "trace")]
//! # {
//! use opentelemetry::{global, trace::{Span, Tracer}, KeyValue};
//!
//! // get a tracer from a provider
//! let tracer = global::tracer("my_service");
//!
//! // start a new span
//! let mut span = tracer.start("my_span");
//!
//! // set some attributes
//! span.set_attribute(KeyValue::new("http.client_ip", "83.164.160.102"));
//!
//! // perform some more work...
//!
//! // end or drop the span to export
//! span.end();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`trace`] module docs for more information on creating and managing
//! spans.
//!
//! [`Span`]: crate::trace::Span
//!
//! # Metrics
//!
//! Note: the metrics specification is **still in progress** and **subject to major
//! changes**.
//!
//! The [`metrics`] module includes types for recording measurements about a
//! service at runtime.
//!
//! ### Creating instruments and recording measurements
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "metrics")]
//! # {
//! use opentelemetry::{global, Context, KeyValue};
//!
//! let cx = Context::current();
//!
//! // get a meter from a provider
//! let meter = global::meter("my_service");
//!
//! // create an instrument
//! let counter = meter.u64_counter("my_counter").init();
//!
//! // record a measurement
//! counter.add(&cx, 1, &[KeyValue::new("http.client_ip", "83.164.160.102")]);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`metrics`] module docs for more information on creating and
//! managing instruments.
//!
//! ## Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! The following core crate feature flags are available:
//!
//! * `trace`: Includes the trace API and SDK (enabled by default).
//! * `metrics`: Includes the unstable metrics API and SDK.
//!
//! Support for recording and exporting telemetry asynchronously can be added
//! via the following flags:
//!
//! * `rt-tokio`: Spawn telemetry tasks using [tokio]'s multi-thread runtime.
//! * `rt-tokio-current-thread`: Spawn telemetry tasks on a separate runtime so that the main runtime won't be blocked.
//! * `rt-async-std`: Spawn telemetry tasks using [async-std]'s runtime.
//!
//! [tokio]: https://crates.io/crates/tokio
//! [async-std]: https://crates.io/crates/async-std
//!
//! ## Related Crates
//!
//! In addition to `opentelemetry`, the [`open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust`]
//! repository contains several additional crates designed to be used with the
//! `opentelemetry` ecosystem. This includes a collection of trace
//! `SpanExporter` and metrics pull and push controller implementations, as well
//! as utility and adapter crates to assist in propagating state and
//! instrumenting applications.
//!
//! In particular, the following crates are likely to be of interest:
//!
//! - [`opentelemetry-http`] provides an interface for injecting and extracting
//!   trace information from [`http`] headers.
//! - [`opentelemetry-jaeger`] provides a pipeline and exporter for sending
//!   trace information to [`Jaeger`].
//! - [`opentelemetry-otlp`] exporter for sending trace and metric data in the
//!   OTLP format to the OpenTelemetry collector.
//! - [`opentelemetry-prometheus`] provides a pipeline and exporter for sending
//!   metrics information to [`Prometheus`].
//! - [`opentelemetry-zipkin`] provides a pipeline and exporter for sending
//!   trace information to [`Zipkin`].
//! - [`opentelemetry-datadog`] provides additional exporters to [`Datadog`].
//! - [`opentelemetry-aws`] provides unofficial propagators for AWS X-ray.
//! - [`opentelemetry-contrib`] provides additional exporters and propagators that are
//!   experimental.
//! - [`opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`] provides standard names and
//!   semantic otel conventions.
//! - [`opentelemetry-stackdriver`] provides an exporter for Google's [Cloud Trace]
//!   (which used to be called StackDriver).
//!
//! Additionally, there are also several third-party crates which are not
//! maintained by the `opentelemetry` project. These include:
//!
//! - [`tracing-opentelemetry`] provides integration for applications
//!   instrumented using the [`tracing`] API and ecosystem.
//! - [`actix-web-opentelemetry`] provides integration for the [`actix-web`] web
//!   server and ecosystem.
//! - [`opentelemetry-application-insights`] provides an unofficial [Azure
//!   Application Insights] exporter.
//! - [`opentelemetry-tide`] provides integration for the [`Tide`] web server
//!   and ecosystem.
//!
//! If you're the maintainer of an `opentelemetry` ecosystem crate not listed
//! above, please let us know! We'd love to add your project to the list!

//! ## Supported Rust Versions
//!
//! OpenTelemetry is built against the latest stable release. The minimum
//! supported version is 1.56. The current OpenTelemetry version is not
//! guaranteed to build on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported
//! version.
//!
//! The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions
//! before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable
//! compiler version is 1.49, the minimum supported version will not be
//! increased past 1.46, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum
//! supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as
//! long as doing so complies with this policy.
