//! # OpenTelemetry Span interface
//!
//! A `Span` represents a single operation within a trace. `Span`s can be nested to form a trace
//! tree. Each trace contains a root span, which typically describes the end-to-end latency and,
//! optionally, one or more sub-spans for its sub-operations.
//!
//! The `Span`'s start and end timestamps reflect the elapsed real time of the operation. A `Span`'s
//! start time SHOULD be set to the current time on span creation. After the `Span` is created, it
//! SHOULD be possible to change its name, set its `Attributes`, and add `Links` and `Events`.
//! These MUST NOT be changed after the `Span`'s end time has been set.
//!
//! `Spans` are not meant to be used to propagate information within a process. To prevent misuse,
//! implementations SHOULD NOT provide access to a `Span`'s attributes besides its `SpanContext`.
//!
//! Vendors may implement the `Span` interface to effect vendor-specific logic. However, alternative
//! implementations MUST NOT allow callers to create Spans directly. All `Span`s MUST be created
//! via a Tracer.

/// `SpanKind` describes the relationship between the Span, its parents,

/// properties that benefit tracing systems during analysis.
///
/// The first property described by `SpanKind` reflects whether the `Span`
/// is a remote child or parent. `Span`s with a remote parent are
/// interesting because they are sources of external load. `Span`s with a
/// remote child are interesting because they reflect a non-local system
/// dependency.
///
/// The second property described by `SpanKind` reflects whether a child
/// `Span` represents a synchronous call.  When a child span is synchronous,
/// the parent is expected to wait for it to complete under ordinary
/// circumstances.  It can be useful for tracing systems to know this
/// property, since synchronous `Span`s may contribute to the overall trace
/// latency. Asynchronous scenarios can be remote or local.
///
/// In order for `SpanKind` to be meaningful, callers should arrange that
/// a single `Span` does not serve more than one purpose.  For example, a
/// server-side span should not be used directly as the parent of another
/// remote span.  As a simple guideline, instrumentation should create a
/// new `Span` prior to extracting and serializing the span context for a
/// remote call.
