/// The interface for constructing [`Span`]s.
///
/// ## In Synchronous Code
///
/// Spans can be created and nested manually:
///
/// ```
/// use opentelemetry::{global, trace::{Span, Tracer, TraceContextExt}, Context};
///
/// let tracer = global::tracer("my-component");
///
/// let parent = tracer.start("foo");
/// let parent_cx = Context::current_with_span(parent);
/// let mut child = tracer.start_with_context("bar", &parent_cx);
///
/// // ...
///
/// child.end(); // explicitly end
/// drop(parent_cx) // or implicitly end on drop
/// ```
///
/// Spans can also use the current thread's [`Context`] to track which span is active:
///
/// ```
/// use opentelemetry::{global, trace::{SpanKind, Tracer}};
///
/// let tracer = global::tracer("my-component");
///
/// // Create simple spans with `in_span`
/// tracer.in_span("foo", |_foo_cx| {
///     // parent span is active
///     tracer.in_span("bar", |_bar_cx| {
///         // child span is now the active span and associated with the parent span
///     });
///     // child has ended, parent now the active span again
/// });
/// // parent has ended, no active spans
/// ```
///
/// Spans can also be marked as active, and the resulting guard allows for
/// greater control over when the span is no longer considered active.
///
/// ```
/// use opentelemetry::{global, trace::{Span, Tracer, mark_span_as_active}};
/// let tracer = global::tracer("my-component");
///
/// let parent_span = tracer.start("foo");
/// let parent_active = mark_span_as_active(parent_span);
///
/// {
///     let child = tracer.start("bar");
///     let _child_active = mark_span_as_active(child);
///
///     // do work in the context of the child span...
///
///     // exiting the scope drops the guard, child is no longer active
/// }
/// // Parent is active span again
///
/// // Parent can be dropped manually, or allowed to go out of scope as well.
/// drop(parent_active);
///
/// // no active span
/// ```
///
/// ## In Asynchronous Code
///
/// If you are instrumenting code that make use of [`std::future::Future`] or
/// async/await, be sure to use the [`FutureExt`] trait. This is needed because
/// the following example _will not_ work:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use opentelemetry::{global, trace::{Tracer, mark_span_as_active}};
/// # let tracer = global::tracer("foo");
/// # let span = tracer.start("foo-span");
/// async {
///     // Does not work
///     let _g = mark_span_as_active(span);
///     // ...
/// };
/// ```
///
/// The context guard `_g` will not exit until the future generated by the
/// `async` block is complete. Since futures can be entered and exited
/// _multiple_ times without them completing, the span remains active for as
/// long as the future exists, rather than only when it is polled, leading to
/// very confusing and incorrect output.
///
/// In order to trace asynchronous code, the [`Future::with_context`] combinator
/// can be used:
///
/// ```
/// # async fn run() -> Result<(), ()> {
/// use opentelemetry::{trace::FutureExt, Context};
/// let cx = Context::current();
///
/// let my_future = async {
///     // ...
/// };
///
/// my_future
///     .with_context(cx)
///     .await;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// [`Future::with_context`] attaches a context to the future, ensuring that the
/// context's lifetime is as long as the future's.
///

/// [`Future::with_context`]: crate::trace::FutureExt::with_context()
