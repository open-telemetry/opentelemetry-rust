//! # OpenTelemetry Tracer Provider Interface
//!
//! ### Obtaining a Tracer
//!
//! New `Tracer` instances can be created via a `TracerProvider` and its `get_tracer`
//! method. This method expects an Into<String> argument:
//!
//! - `name` (required): This name must identify the instrumentation library (also
//!   referred to as integration, e.g. `io.opentelemetry.contrib.mongodb`) and *not*
//!   the instrumented library.
//!   In case an invalid name (empty string) is specified, a working
//!   default Tracer implementation as a fallback is returned rather than returning
//!   None or throwing an exception.
//!   A library, implementing the OpenTelemetry API *may* also ignore this name and
//!   return a default instance for all calls, if it does not support "named"
//!   functionality (e.g. an implementation which is not even observability-related).
//!   A TracerProvider could also return a no-op Tracer here if application owners configure
//!   the SDK to suppress telemetry produced by this library.
//!
//! Implementations might require the user to specify configuration properties at
//! `TracerProvider` creation time, or rely on external configurations.
