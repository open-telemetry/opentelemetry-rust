/// Control flow is bi-directional through the `MetricReader`, since the SDK
/// initiates `force_flush` and `shutdown` while the reader initiates
/// collection. The `register_pipeline` method here informs the metric reader
/// that it can begin reading, signaling the start of bi-directional control
/// flow.
///
/// Typically, push-based exporters that are periodic will implement
/// `MetricExporter` themselves and construct a `PeriodicReader` to satisfy this
/// interface.
///
/// Pull-based exporters will typically implement `MetricReader` themselves,
/// since they read on demand.
