# Contributing to opentelemetry-rust

The Rust special interest group (SIG) meets weekly on Tuesdays at 9 AM Pacific
Time. The meeting is subject to change depending on contributors'
availability. Check the [OpenTelemetry community
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com)
for specific dates and for Zoom meeting links. "OTel Rust SIG" is the name of
meeting for this group.

Meeting notes are available as a public [Google
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tGKuCsSnyT2McDncVJrMgg74_z8V06riWZa0Sr79I_4/edit).
If you have trouble accessing the doc, please get in touch on
[Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03GDP0H023).

The meeting is open for all to join. We invite everyone to join our meeting,
regardless of your experience level. Whether you're a seasoned OpenTelemetry
developer, just starting your journey, or simply curious about the work we do,
you're more than welcome to participate!

## Pull Requests

### Prerequisites

Crate `opentelemetry-otlp` uses gRPC + Protocol Buffers.
You can provide the protocol compiler protoc path programmatically (only works with tonic) or build it from source

```sh
export PROTOC=$(which protoc)
```

Prerequisites to build the protocol compiler protoc from source

- [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
- [cmake](https://cmake.org)
- [llvm](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) (and `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable pointing to the `bin` directory of LLVM install)

### How to Send Pull Requests

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to `opentelemetry-rust` via
GitHub pull requests (PRs).

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust
```

Enter the newly created directory and add your fork as a new remote:

```sh
git remote add <YOUR_FORK> git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/opentelemetry-rust
```

Check out a new branch, make modifications, run linters and tests, and
push the branch to your fork:

```sh
$ git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
# edit files
$ git add -p
$ git commit
$ git push <YOUR_FORK> <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

Open a pull request against the main
[opentelemetry-rust](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust)
repo.

> **Note**
> It is recommended to run [pre-commit script](precommit.sh) from the root of
the repo to catch any issues locally.

### How to Receive Comments

- If the PR is not ready for review, please put `[WIP]` in the title or mark it
  as [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
- Make sure CLA is signed and all required CI checks are clear.
- Submit small, focused PRs addressing a single concern/issue.
- Make sure the PR title reflects the contribution.
- Write a summary that helps understand the change.
- Include usage examples in the summary, where applicable.
- Include benchmarks (before/after) in the summary, for contributions that are
  performance enhancements.

### How to Get PRs Merged

A PR is considered to be **ready to merge** when:

- It has received approval from
  [Approvers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/community-membership.md#approver).
  /
  [Maintainers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/community-membership.md#maintainer).
- Major feedbacks are resolved.

Any Maintainer can merge the PR once it is **ready to merge**. Note, that some
PRs may not be merged immediately if the repo is in the process of a release and
the maintainers decided to defer the PR to the next release train. Also,
maintainers may decide to wait for more than one approval for certain PRs,
particularly ones that are affecting multiple areas, or topics that may warrant
more discussion.

## Design Choices

As with other OpenTelemetry clients, opentelemetry-rust follows the
[opentelemetry-specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification).

It's especially valuable to read through the [library
guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/library-guidelines.md).

### Focus on Capabilities, Not Structure Compliance

OpenTelemetry is an evolving specification, one where the desires and
use cases are clear, but the method to satisfy those uses cases are
not.

As such, Contributions should provide functionality and behavior that
conforms to the specification, but the interface and structure is
flexible.

It is preferable to have contributions follow the idioms of the
language rather than conform to specific API names or argument
patterns in the spec.

For a deeper discussion, see:
<https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/165>

### Error Handling

Currently, the Opentelemetry Rust SDK has two ways to handle errors. In the situation where errors are not allowed to return. One should call global error handler to process the errors. Otherwise, one should return the errors.

The Opentelemetry Rust SDK comes with an error type `opentelemetry::Error`. For different function, one error has been defined. All error returned by trace module MUST be wrapped in `opentelemetry::trace::TraceError`. All errors returned by metrics module MUST be wrapped in `opentelemetry::metrics::MetricsError`. All errors returned by logs module MUST be wrapped in `opentelemetry::logs::LogsError`.

For users that want to implement their own exporters. It's RECOMMENDED to wrap all errors from the exporter into a crate-level error type, and implement `ExporterError` trait.

### Priority of configurations

OpenTelemetry supports multiple ways to configure the API, SDK and other components. The priority of configurations is as follows:

- Environment variables
- Compiling time configurations provided in the source code

### Experimental/Unstable features:

Use `otel_unstable` feature flag for implementation of specification with [experimental](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.27.0/specification/document-status.md) status. This approach ensures clear demarcation and safe integration of new or evolving features. Utilize the following structure:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "otel_unstable")]
{
    // Your feature implementation
}
```
It's important to regularly review and remove the `otel_unstable` flag from the code once the feature becomes stable. This cleanup process is crucial to maintain the overall code quality and to ensure that stable features are accurately reflected in the main build.

### Optional features:

The potential features include:

- Stable and non-experimental features that compliant to specification, and have a feature flag to minimize compilation size. Example: feature flags for signals (like `logs`, `traces`, `metrics`) and runtimes (`rt-tokio`, `rt-tokio-current-thread`, `rt-async-std`).
- Stable and non-experimental features, although not part of the specification, are crucial for enhancing the tracing/log crate's functionality or boosting performance. These features are also subject to discussion and approval by the OpenTelemetry Rust Maintainers. An example of such a feature is `logs_level_enabled`.

All such features should adhere to naming convention  `<signal>_<feature_name>`

## Style Guide

- Run `cargo clippy --all` - this will catch common mistakes and improve
your Rust code
- Run `cargo fmt` - this will find and fix code formatting
issues.

## Testing and Benchmarking

- Run `cargo test --all` - this will execute code and doc tests for all
projects in this workspace.
- Run `cargo bench` - this will run benchmarks to show performance
- Run `cargo bench` - this will run benchmarks to show performance
regressions

## FAQ

### Where should I put third party propagators/exporters, contrib or standalone crates?

As of now, the specification classify the propagators into three categories:
Fully opened standards, platform-specific standards, proprietary headers. The
conclusion is only the fully opened standards should live in SDK packages/repos.
So here, only fully opened standards should live as independent crate. For more
detail and discussion, see [this
pr](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/1144).
